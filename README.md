# Hobby Recommender App

## Description

The Hobby Recommender App is a Flutter-based mobile application that uses the Gemini API to
recommend hobbies based on user preferences. The app prompts users with 5 questions, collects their
answers, and generates 2-4 personalized hobby recommendations. Each hobby recommendation is
displayed on the result screen with a description and a personalized explanation from the AI about
why the hobby suits the user. The app also includes a theme-switching feature with 3 color palettes
and a navigation bar for easy navigation.
